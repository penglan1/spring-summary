    You can also control lazy-initialization at the container level by using the default-lazy-init
    attribute on the <beans/> element;

    <!--
    By default, ApplicationContext implementations eagerly create and configure all singleton beans as
    part of the initialization process. Generally, this pre-instantiation is desirable, because errors in the
    configuration or surrounding environment are discovered immediately, as opposed to hours or
    even days later. When this behavior is not desirable, you can prevent pre-instantiation of a
    singleton bean by marking the bean definition as lazy-initialized. A lazy-initialized bean tells the
    IoC container to create a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup.
