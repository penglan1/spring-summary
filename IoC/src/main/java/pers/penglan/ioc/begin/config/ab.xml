    You can always use fully qualified resource locations instead of relative paths: for
    example, "file:C:/config/services.xml" or "classpath:/config/services.xml". However,
    be aware that you are coupling your application’s configuration to specific
    absolute locations. It is generally preferable to keep an indirection for such
    absolute locations, for example, through "${…}" placeholders that are resolved
    against JVM system properties at runtime.
